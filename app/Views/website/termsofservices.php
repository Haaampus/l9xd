			<p>L6: If you play any games on the account the booster is working on without notification, we have full rights to stop the order without refund.</p>
			<p>L7: If your LP gain is 17 lp or lower , we have the right to turn your order into net wins. You will be notified if you are getting 17 LP or lower a game and then should you decide if you would like to continue in net wins or an other possible agreement between both sides.</p>

			<p>Kattboost: If you start a chargeback you are in direct breach of Kattboost.com’s terms of use, and will not be refunded as we have full rights to tell Paypal's dispute support team that you have checked off our terms of service between purchasing.</p>
			<p>L10: Boosting goes against Riot's terms of service .

			<p>L11: When purchasing an order, you are eligible for a refund within 48 hours of it's purchase, this only applies if the booster did not start working in your account within the giving time. </p>
